I really don't know what to put in this page, but hi. Here's a quote from Finding Nemo though by Dory:  <br />
> Just keep swimming.

Let's be honest here. I can't swim. I mean, I can float, but I can't swim. (Pathetic. I know)  <br />
Also I just found the cheatsheet for markdown! Pretty cool. I'll give you the link in links.  <br /><br />

```javascript
function wuhu(){
    console.log("Uye. This feels like Discord. I love it.");
}
```
