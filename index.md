I really don't know what to put in this page, but hi! Here's a quote from Finding Nemo though by Dory:  <br />
> Just keep swimming.

Kind of ironic that the first quote that came to mind was... _that._ I mean, I can't swim, lol.  <br />
Also, I found the [cheatsheet for markdown](https://enterprise.github.com/downloads/en/markdown-cheatsheet.pdf)! Pretty cool. <br /><br />

[GitHub OS212 repository](https://github.com/huanis/os212/) | [My log](https://huanis.github.io/os212/TXT/mylog.txt) | [Links](links.md)

Hold on. I want to try something.
```javascript
function wuhu(){
    console.log("Uye. This feels like Discord. I love it.");
}
```
