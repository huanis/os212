I really don't know what to put in this page, but hi. Here's a quote from Finding Nemo though by Dory:  <br />
> Just keep swimming.

Let's be honest here. I can't swim. I mean, I can float, but I can't swim. (Pathetic. I know)  <br />
Also I just found the [cheatsheet for markdown](https://enterprise.github.com/downloads/en/markdown-cheatsheet.pdf)! Pretty cool. <br /><br />

Hold on. I want to try something.
```javascript
function wuhu(){
    console.log("Uye. This feels like Discord. I love it.");
}
```
