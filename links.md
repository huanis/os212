- [Intro to Linux Basic Commands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMGixkvJ-6w) <br>
(A youtube vid) Introduces you to some basic commands in Linux, like cd, cat, and mv.
- [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://enterprise.github.com/downloads/en/markdown-cheatsheet.pdf) <br>
Can help with designing your web pages! Well, if it's written in markdown of course. Definitely helped me seeing how I don't know anything about web design.
- [Nano Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf0ZJZJ8jlI) <br>
(Another youtube vid) This one introduces you to one of Linux's text editor, nano! It's simple and not hard to understand. However, there's a chance that you wouldn't get a full mark if you use nano, which is why I added a link for a tutorial about vim.
- [picoCTF](https://picoctf.org/) <br>
__picoCTF is a free computer security game!__ From what I saw, I think it could help familiarize yourself with CMD. [Here](https://youtu.be/P07NH5F-t3s) is a video about it I found on YouTube a while back.
- [Vim Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVwgwaDmZp4) <br>
Vim is an upgrade of the vi editor in Linux. This video really helped me write a new file using vim (which is myrank.txt) and I thought I should share this.
- [Linux Commands: mount and unmount](https://www.computerhope.com/unix/umount.htm) <br>
I wasn't really sure what mount and unmount does. How it worked. Someone asked about it too in class. So, I thought I should share this.
- [Pointers in C](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pointers-in-c-and-c-set-1-introduction-arithmetic-and-array/) <br>
Other than that one meme in the OS server, I this article could help us understand better about pointers.
- [Dynamic Allocation in C](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-memory-allocation-in-c-using-malloc-calloc-free-and-realloc/) <br>
This is where I got my answer for one the questions posted in the forum for week 04. It gives me a better understanding on how to use dynamic allocation in C and how it works.
